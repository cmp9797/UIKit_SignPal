### App description 
An interactive sign language companion app that utilized Apple’s machine learning technology. It helps users to classify the hand-sign poses into text or voice. The app enables users to enhance their knowledge of sign language through an engaging mini-game. The app provides real-time translation and a guessing game to foster improved communication with individuals who have speech or hearing disabilities.

### How the App Works
1. **Real-time Translation**: 
Users can initiate the translation by enabling access to their device's camera and posing their hands. The app captures and displays the translation on the device screen in real-time.

2. **Text-to-speech voice-over**: 
The app provides text-to-speech voice-over to hear the translation results. It engages the users who prefer listening over reading by giving them other alternatives. Moreover, this application can also be utilized as an educational resource, especially for young children.

3. **Simple gamification**: 
The app incorporates a question-based gamification that requires them to respond using hand-sign poses. This app encourages users to actively participate and express their understanding of sign language through gestures. Through this hands-on approach, users can strengthen their knowledge and fluency in sign language while gaining confidence in their ability to communicate effectively through hand gestures.
